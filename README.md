# Microsoft Office Macros

I have written some macros for Microsoft Office.

* [Outlook Reply To All](https://github.com/ndmitchell/bake/blob/master/ReplyToAll.md#readme) - to provide Reply To All if that feature has been disabled by your organisation. Click through for an easy to use installation guide.
* [PowerPoint flattener](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndmitchell/office/master/PowerFlat.bas) - to convert a PowerPoint presentation with animation into a flat PowerPoint without animation (suitable for conversion to PDF). Click through for the source code, which needs installing as a macro and running - intended for more advanced users.
